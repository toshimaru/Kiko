When you set `log_level` `:info` (mostly on production server), the SQL outputs are disabled in `rails console`.

```rb
# Rails Configuration
Rails.application.configure do
  ...
  config.log_level = :info
  ...
end
```

```ruby
> Model.count
=> 12345
```

If you want to see SQL generated by `Model.count`, you need to set logger level manually.

```rb
Rails.logger.level = :debug
```

```rb
> Rails.logger.level = :debug
=> :debug

> Model.count
   (1.8ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `models`
=> 12345
```

Now, you can check the queries in `rails console`.
