To retrieve unique values from a column in ActiveRecord, the `distinct` method combined with `pluck` can be utilized.

```rb
Model.distinct.pluck(:column)
```

For instance:

```rb
User.distinct.pluck(:id)
#    (0.1ms)  SELECT DISTINCT "users"."id" FROM "users"
```

This approach can also be extended to obtain unique values from multiple columns.

```rb
User.distinct.pluck(:id, :name)
#    (0.1ms)  SELECT DISTINCT "users"."id", "users"."name" FROM "users"
```
