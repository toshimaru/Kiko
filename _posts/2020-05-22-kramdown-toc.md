If you use [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) (default markdown renderer for [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)), you can easily add ToC (Table of Contents) to your markdown contents.

Just add the snippet to the position where you want to show the ToC.

```
* toc
{:toc}
```

## Table of Contents for this post

Let's add ToC in this post.

ðŸ‘‡

* toc
{:toc}

It's working correctly! :)
