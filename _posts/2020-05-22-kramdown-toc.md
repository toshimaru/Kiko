If you use [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) (which is a default markdown renderer for [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)), you can easily add TOC (Table of Contents) to your markdown contents.

Just add the snippet to the position where you want to show the TOC.

```
* toc
{:toc}
```

## Table of Contents for this post
