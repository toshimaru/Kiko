Would you like to measure code coverage on [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) in Go?

## Viewing Coverage Result

All you need to is adding `-coverprofile c.out` option to `go test` command.

```
$ go test ./... -coverprofile c.out
```

`c.out` is a test coverage result file.

## Sending Coverage Result

This is a sample to send coverage result on TravisCI.

```bash
curl -L https://codeclimate.com/downloads/test-reporter/test-reporter-latest-linux-amd64 > ./cc-test-reporter
chmod +x ./cc-test-reporter
./cc-test-reporter before-build
# RUN TEST HERE
# go test ./... -coverprofile c.out
./cc-test-reporter after-build --exit-code $TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT
```

## Sample Setting for TravisCI

Whole sample for TravisCI:

```yaml
language: go
before_script:
  - curl -L https://codeclimate.com/downloads/test-reporter/test-reporter-latest-linux-amd64 > ./cc-test-reporter
  - chmod +x ./cc-test-reporter
  - ./cc-test-reporter before-build
script:
  - go test ./... -coverprofile c.out
after_script:
  - ./cc-test-reporter after-build --exit-code $TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT
```
